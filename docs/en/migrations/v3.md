# Migrate from Version 3

Compared with the 3.x version, Kurimudb 4.x has many changes. They may be some new features or some incompatible changes. This document will explain the specific changes for you in detail.

## Disruptive Changes

### Model Definition

In the 4.x version, some default values and automatic inference were added to the definition model.

```js
export default new (class ConfigState extends Models.keyValue<
  // In version 4.x, it is no longer necessary to define the type of data, and the default is Record<string | number, any>
  // Record<string | number, any>
> {
  constructor() {
    super({
      // In version 4.x, the model name can be omitted. Omit will use the class name of the current class.
      // name: "ConfigState",
      // In the 4.x version, the type can be omitted. If omitted, the key-value model will be'string', and the collection model will be 'number'.
      // type: "string",
    });
  }
})();
```

### Model Function

- The `yourModel.all()` function is changed to be available only under the collection model.

- When fetching data that does not exist in the model, you will get `null` originally, but now you will get `undefined`.

### Model Subscription

The original return value of the bulk subscription function was an array containing all the values of unsubscription. Now the return value has been changed to a function to unsubscribe all the values of this bulk subscription after execution.

```js
// version 3.x
const unsubscribeFunctions = batch$(...);
for (const unsubscribe of unsubscribeFunctions) {
    unsubscribe();
}

// version 4.x
const unsubscribe = batch$(...);
unsubscribe();
```

### Storage Api Class

The syntax of the `subscribeItem` function in the Storage Api class is now changed as follows:

```js
// version 3.x
local.subscribeItem("say")((val) => { ... });
// version 4.x
local.subscribeItem("say", (val) => { ... });
```

## New Functions and Features

### Simplified Model Filling

In addition to passing in a closure, you can also pass in an object or array to fill the key-value model or collection model respectively.

```js
// key-value model:
this.seed({
  foo: 'bar',
  baz: 'qux',
});
// Is equivalent to:
this.seed(() => {
  this.data.foo = 'bar';
  this.data.baz = 'qux';
});
```

```js
// Collection model:
this.seed(['foo', 'bar']);
// Is equivalent to:
this.seed(() => {
  this.insert('foo');
  this.insert('bar');
});
```

### Auto Subscription Function

When any of the values used in the closure is changed, the closure will be executed again:

```js
auto$(() => {
  console.log(configState.data.foo);
  console.log(configState.data.bar);
});
```

## Model Driver change

> ðŸ“œ To use Kurimudb 4.x version, all driver versions need to be upgraded to 4.x as well.

### LocalStorage

The LocalStorage driver now supports the use of the `all()` function.

### Dexie

The location where the `db` parameter of the Dexie driver is passed is changed from the original definition of a **class member variable** to the definition in the **constructor**.

```js {3}
// version 3.x
export default new (class NoteList extends Models.collection {
  db: Dexie = db;

  constructor() {
    super({
      // ...
    });
  }
})();
```

```js {6}
// version 4.x
export default new (class NoteList extends Models.collection {
  constructor() {
    super({
      // ...
      db: db,
    });
  }
})();
```
