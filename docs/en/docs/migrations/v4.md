# Migrate from Version 4

Compared with the 4.x version, Kurimudb 5.x has many changes. They may be some new features or some incompatible changes. This document will elaborate on the specific changes for you.

## General

Kurimudb 5.x version mainly made some following improvements:

1. Overall refactoring, perfect testing, optimize code readability;

2. More complete and rigorous TypeScript type support, and added a lot of automatic inference, thank you very much for the help provided by [@TheNightmareX](https://github.com/TheNightmareX)

3. In addition to auto-increment, the primary key of the collection model can also be customized now. We can use distributed ID generation algorithms such as Snowflake ID and UUID to generate the primary key to develop cloud synchronization functions. We can also create a custom algorithm to satisfy Business needs.

4. To be continued...

## Discruptive Changes

### Change the Primary Key Type to String

In the old version, the primary key of the model is divided into two types: `string` and `number`.
